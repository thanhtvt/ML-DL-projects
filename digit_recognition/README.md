# Digit Recognition with MNIST dataset  
## Overview  
The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.  

## About files  
- [digit_recog.py](https://github.com/thanhtvt/ML-DL-projects/blob/main/digit_recognition/digit_recog.py): Training and validating model to predict/recognise digits from mnist dataset.
- [mnist.h5](https://github.com/thanhtvt/ML-DL-projects/blob/main/digit_recognition/mnist.h5): Saved model after training successfully.
- [recog_gui.py](https://github.com/thanhtvt/ML-DL-projects/blob/main/digit_recognition/recog_gui.py): GUI for drawing digits which are recognised by model.  

## Version
### Ver 1:   
- Prediction with test set of MNIST has great result (99.993% accuracy)
- Prediction with digit drawn on Canvas does not have great result 

#### Future updates:
- Improve accuracy of GUI prediction
- Add feature to upload image into GUI prediction
